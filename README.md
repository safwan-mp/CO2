# CO2 Emission Prediction 🚗🌱

This project predicts the CO2 emissions of cars based on their technical specifications using machine learning models.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build machine learning models that can predict car CO2 emissions (g/km) using features like engine size, fuel consumption, and cylinders.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Results
| Model | RMSE | R² Score |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Linear Regression | XX | XX |
| Random Forest | XX | XX |
| SVM | XX | XX |
